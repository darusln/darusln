Hello! I'm Darius and I'm in my 3rd year studying mathematics and computer science at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca!
I like to learn about all kinds of new things and explore new possibilities. I have had my fair share of experience with several programming languages such as C++, Java, C#, Python and even HTML and Javascript/Typescript.
I have worked on some personal projects, but also some that are team related. I've managed to work in teams quite well and get along with other people in order to create great stuff!
For contact my email is rauldariusbuda@gmail.com .![yellow-waving-hello-hand-6p1ptjoz34zl421c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2bc4419-12da-46f2-aa98-7388df478703)
